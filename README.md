# heatmap-calendar-react
An interactive calendar with heatmap visualization. Based on GitHub's commit graph.

The user can interact with the calendar using hover, click, click & drag, month selection and weekday selection. As well as navigate through the calendar with their selection using arrow keys: left, right, up, down, esc to cancel. Once the user has selected a date (or multiple dates) they can use the shift key to expand their selection. E.g. shift + right arrow key to expand right.
